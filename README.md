# What Better106Exits does, why it's a good plugin 
Better 106 exits randomizes pocket dimension exits! Now, when escaping, you can spawn anywhere around the facility! In the light zone, in the hard zone, at the doctor's spawn, in the entrance, and, in very rare cases, even on the surface! Now, there is no advantage for 2 class d that have black card, that have been captured by 106 and that have found the way out. 
They will just spawn in the facility, and, if they want, recontain 106 later, but they'll have to find his chamber first!


# Configs
There is only 1 config (i'm going to add more):

**`b106exits_enabled: true`**

It enables/disables plugin. For some that don't understand: **`b106exits_enabled: true`** - plugin is enabled, `b106exits_enabled: false` - plugin is disabled.
